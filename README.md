[Link to Report](InvestigatingFoulingEfficiencyInFootballUsingExpectedBooking(xB)Model.pdf)
This paper introduces the Expected Booking (xB) model, a novel metric designed to estimate the likelihood of a foul resulting in a yellow card in football. Through three itera- tive experiments, employing ensemble methods, the model demonstrates improved performance with additional fea- tures and an expanded dataset. Analysis of FIFA World Cup 2022 data validates the modelâ€™s efficacy in providing insights into team and player fouling tactics, aligning with actual defensive performance. The xB model addresses a gap in fouling efficiency examination, emphasizing defen- sive strategies which often overlooked. Further enhance- ments are suggested through the incorporation of compre- hensive data and spatial features.
